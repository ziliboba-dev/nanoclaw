description: Efficiently bring upstream NanoClaw updates into a customized install, with preview, selective cherry-pick, and low token usage.

# About

Your NanoClaw fork drifts from upstream as you customize it. This skill pulls upstream changes into your install without losing your modifications.

Run `/update-nanoclaw` in Claude Code.

## How it works

**Preflight**: checks for clean working tree (`git status --porcelain`). If `upstream` remote is missing, asks you for the URL (defaults to `https://github.com/nanocoai/nanoclaw.git`) and adds it. Detects the upstream branch name (`main` or `master`).

**Backup**: creates a timestamped backup branch and tag (`backup/pre-update-<hash>-<timestamp>`, `pre-update-<hash>-<timestamp>`) before touching anything. Safe to run multiple times.

**Preview**: runs `git log` and `git diff` against the merge base to show upstream changes since your last sync. Groups changed files into categories:
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): unlikely to conflict unless you edited an upstream skill
- **Host source** (`src/`): may conflict if you modified the same files
- **Container** (`container/`): triggers container rebuild
- **Build/config** (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig*.json`): lockfile changes trigger dep install

**Update paths** (you pick one):
- `merge` (default): `git merge upstream/<branch>`. Resolves all conflicts in one pass.
- `cherry-pick`: `git cherry-pick <hashes>`. Pull in only the commits you want.
- `rebase`: `git rebase upstream/<branch>`. Linear history, but conflicts resolve per-commit.
- `abort`: just view the changelog, change nothing.

**Conflict preview**: before merging, runs a dry-run (`git merge --no-commit --no-ff`) to show which files would conflict. You can still abort at this point.

**Conflict resolution**: opens only conflicted files, resolves the conflict markers, keeps your local customizations intact.

**Validation**: runs `pnpm run build` and `pnpm test`. If container files changed, also runs the container typecheck and `./container/build.sh`.

**Breaking changes check**: after validation, reads CHANGELOG.md for any `[BREAKING]` entries introduced by the update. If found, shows each breaking change, reads its migration skill or guide, and offers the recommended migration.

## Rollback

The backup tag is printed at the end of each run:
```
git reset --hard pre-update-<hash>-<timestamp>
```

Backup branch `backup/pre-update-<hash>-<timestamp>` also exists.

## Token usage

Only opens files with actual conflicts. Uses `git log`, `git diff`, and `git status` for everything else. Does not scan or refactor unrelated code.

# Goal
Help a user with a customized NanoClaw install safely incorporate upstream changes without a fresh reinstall and without blowing tokens.

# Operating principles
- Never proceed with a dirty working tree.
- Always create a rollback point (backup branch + tag) before touching anything.
- Prefer git-native operations (fetch, merge, cherry-pick). Do not manually rewrite files except conflict markers.
- Default to MERGE (one-pass conflict resolution). Offer REBASE as an explicit option.
- Keep token usage low: rely on `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, and open only conflicted files.

# Step 0a: Refresh this skill first
The update process itself evolves, so run its newest version before doing anything else:
- Ensure the `upstream` remote exists (default `https://github.com/nanocoai/nanoclaw.git`) and fetch: `git fetch upstream --prune`. Detect the upstream branch (`main` or `master`).
- Read the upstream skill without changing the working tree:
  `git show upstream/<branch>:.claude/skills/update-nanoclaw/SKILL.md`.
- If it differs from the local copy, **follow the upstream version from the top**
  instead of this one. The merge will bring that version into the checkout.

# Step 0: Preflight (stop early if unsafe)
Run:
- `git status --porcelain`
If output is non-empty:
- Tell the user to commit or stash first, then stop.

Confirm remotes:
- `git remote -v`
If `upstream` is missing:
- Ask the user for the upstream repo URL (default: `https://github.com/nanocoai/nanoclaw.git`).
- Add it: `git remote add upstream <user-provided-url>`
- Then: `git fetch upstream --prune`

Determine the upstream branch name:
- `git branch -r | grep upstream/`
- If `upstream/main` exists, use `main`.
- If only `upstream/master` exists, use `master`.
- Otherwise, ask the user which branch to use.
- Store this as UPSTREAM_BRANCH for all subsequent commands. Every command below that references `upstream/main` should use `upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH` instead.

Fetch:
- `git fetch upstream --prune`

# Step 1: Create a safety net
Capture current state:
- `HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)`
- `TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`

Create backup branch and tag (using timestamp to avoid collisions on retry):
- `git branch backup/pre-update-$HASH-$TIMESTAMP`
- `git tag pre-update-$HASH-$TIMESTAMP`

Save the tag name for later reference in the summary and rollback instructions.

# Step 2: Preview what upstream changed (no edits yet)
Compute common base:
- `BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH)`

Show upstream commits since BASE:
- `git log --oneline $BASE..upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH`

Show local commits since BASE (custom drift):
- `git log --oneline $BASE..HEAD`

Show file-level impact from upstream:
- `git diff --name-only $BASE..upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH`

Bucket the upstream changed files:
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): unlikely to conflict unless the user edited an upstream skill
- **Host source** (`src/`): may conflict if user modified the same files
- **Container** (`container/`): triggers container rebuild (+ typecheck if `agent-runner/src/` changed)
- **Build/config** (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig*.json`): lockfile changes trigger dep install
- **Version pins** (`versions.json`): a changed `onecli-gateway` / `onecli-cli` value requires upgrading the OneCLI gateway/CLI to match — see Step 5.5
- **Other**: docs, tests, setup scripts, misc

**Large drift check:** If the upstream commit count and age suggest the user has a lot of catching up to do, mention that `/migrate-nanoclaw` might be a better fit — it extracts customizations and reapplies them on clean upstream instead of merging. Offer it as an option but don't push.

Present these buckets to the user and ask them to choose one path using AskUserQuestion:
- A) **Full update**: merge all upstream changes
- B) **Selective update**: cherry-pick specific upstream commits
- C) **Abort**: they only wanted the preview
- D) **Rebase mode**: advanced, linear history (warn: resolves conflicts per-commit)

If Abort: stop here.

# Step 3: Conflict preview (before committing anything)
If Full update or Rebase:
- Dry-run merge to preview conflicts. Run these as a single chained command so the abort always executes:
  ```
  git merge --no-commit --no-ff upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH; git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U; git merge --abort
  ```
- If conflicts were listed: show them and ask user if they want to proceed.
- If no conflicts: tell user it is clean and proceed.

# Step 4A: Full update (MERGE, default)
Run:
- `git merge upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH --no-edit`

If conflicts occur:
- Run `git status` and identify conflicted files.
- For each conflicted file:
  - Open the file.
  - Resolve only conflict markers.
  - Preserve intentional local customizations.
  - Incorporate upstream fixes/improvements.
  - Do not refactor surrounding code.
  - `git add <file>`
- When all resolved:
  - If merge did not auto-commit: `git commit --no-edit`

# Step 4B: Selective update (CHERRY-PICK)
If user chose Selective:
- Recompute BASE if needed: `BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH)`
- Show commit list again: `git log --oneline $BASE..upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH`
- Ask user which commit hashes they want.
- Apply: `git cherry-pick <hash1> <hash2> ...`

If conflicts during cherry-pick:
- Resolve only conflict markers, then:
  - `git add <file>`
  - `git cherry-pick --continue`
If user wants to stop:
  - `git cherry-pick --abort`

# Step 4C: Rebase (only if user explicitly chose option D)
Run:
- `git rebase upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH`

If conflicts:
- Resolve conflict markers only, then:
  - `git add <file>`
  - `git rebase --continue`
If it gets messy (more than 3 rounds of conflicts):
  - `git rebase --abort`
  - Recommend merge instead.

# Step 4.5: Install dependencies (if lockfiles changed)
Check if the merge changed any lockfiles or package manifests:
- `git diff <backup-tag-from-step-1>..HEAD --name-only | grep -E '^(pnpm-lock\.yaml|package\.json)$'`
  - If matched: `pnpm install`
- `git diff <backup-tag-from-step-1>..HEAD --name-only | grep -E '^container/agent-runner/(bun\.lock|package\.json)$'`
  - If matched AND `command -v bun` succeeds: `cd container/agent-runner && bun install`
  - If bun is not installed on the host, skip — container deps will be installed during `./container/build.sh`

Skip this step if neither lockfile changed.

# Step 5: Validation
Check which areas changed to determine what to validate:
- `CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only <backup-tag-from-step-1>..HEAD)`

**Host build** (always):
- `pnpm run build`
- `pnpm test` (do not fail the flow if tests are not configured)

**Container typecheck** (only if `container/agent-runner/src/` files are in CHANGED_FILES AND bun types are available):
- Check: `pnpm exec tsc -p container/agent-runner/tsconfig.json --noEmit`
- If this fails because bun types are missing (`Cannot find type definition file for 'bun'`), skip with a note — type errors will surface at container runtime instead

**Container image** (only if any `container/` files are in CHANGED_FILES, or the `agent-image` pin moved):

Which command depends on where this install gets its image — check `.env` for `NANOCLAW_HARDENED_IMAGE=true`.

- **Builds locally** (the default; flag absent or not `true`): `./container/build.sh`
- **Pulls a pinned image** (flag is `true`): `./container/build.sh pull`. Never the bare form — it exits `3` on a pinned install rather than silently replacing the pulled bytes with a local build.

A pinned install needs `pull` in either of two cases, so run it if either holds:
- `git diff <backup-tag-from-step-1>..HEAD -- versions.json` shows the `agent-image` value changed. A new image was published; nothing re-pulls on its own.
- Any `container/` file changed, `container/agent-runner/bun.lock` included.

If `pull` refuses with a lockfile mismatch, that is the guard working, not a bug: the update moved `container/agent-runner/bun.lock` and no image has been published for the new lockfile yet. `/app/src` is bind-mounted from this checkout at spawn, so pairing the old image with the new source dies as a missing module inside a `--rm` container whose logs are discarded. Tell the user and offer the two real options — wait for a published image matching this checkout, or switch this install to local builds with `./container/build.sh build`.

If build fails:
- Show the error.
- Only fix issues clearly caused by the merge (missing imports, type mismatches from merged code).
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- If unclear, ask the user before making changes.

# Step 5.5: OneCLI upgrade (if pins moved)
The OneCLI gateway and CLI are external components pinned in `versions.json`; when a pin moves, the running version must be upgraded to match or the new code may fail against it.

If `git diff <backup-tag-from-step-1>..HEAD -- versions.json` shows the `onecli-gateway` or `onecli-cli` value changed, follow `docs/onecli-upgrades.md` before the service restart (Step 8). Otherwise skip.

# Step 6: Breaking changes check
After validation succeeds, check if the update introduced any breaking changes.

Determine which CHANGELOG entries are new by diffing against the backup tag:
- `git diff <backup-tag-from-step-1>..HEAD -- CHANGELOG.md`

Parse the diff output for lines that contain `[BREAKING]` anywhere in the line.
Each such line is one breaking change entry and references either a migration
skill or a local guide:
```
[BREAKING] <description>. Run `/<skill-name>` to <action>.
[BREAKING] <description>. Follow [the migration guide](docs/<guide>.md).
```

If no `[BREAKING]` lines are found:
- Skip this step silently. Proceed to Step 7.

If one or more `[BREAKING]` lines are found:
- Display a warning header to the user: "This update includes breaking changes that may require action:"
- For each breaking change, display the full description.
- Collect every referenced skill (the `/<skill-name>` part) and local
  `docs/*.md` migration guide.
- Read every referenced guide before presenting its migration. Summarize its
  detect, why, fix, verify, and rollback sections.
- Initialize an unresolved-migrations list with every referenced skill and
  guide. Remove an item only after its migration and verification complete
  successfully.
- Use AskUserQuestion to ask which migrations the user wants to run now. Options:
  - One recommended option per referenced skill (e.g., "Run /add-whatsapp (Recommended)")
  - One recommended option per guide, named for its documented fix
  - "Skip — I'll handle these manually"
- Set `multiSelect: true` so the user can pick multiple migrations if there are several.
- Invoke selected skills with the Skill tool. For a selected guide, follow its
  fix steps and then its verification steps.
- Keep every skipped, failed, or incomplete migration in the unresolved list, then
  proceed to Step 7.

# Step 7: Skill updates (part of updating NanoClaw)

Updating your installed skills is **part of** updating NanoClaw, not an optional
extra. Channel and provider code ships on long-lived branches (`channels`,
`providers`) that the host merge above doesn't touch — so stopping here leaves
that code on whatever version you installed, which is how an important upstream
fix gets silently left behind. The default is to continue into `/update-skills`,
which re-applies your installed channels/providers to pull their latest code.

Detect whether anything is installed: read `src/channels/index.ts` and
`src/providers/index.ts`, collecting `import './<name>.js';` lines (excluding
`cli`).

- If nothing is installed: skip silently and proceed to Step 7.9.
- If one or more are installed: continue into skill updates.

**Hand-off — default in, minimal opt-out.** Use AskUserQuestion (single-select).
Name the installed skills in the question so the choice is concrete:
- Question: "Skill updates are part of this NanoClaw update — your installed
  channels/providers (<list the detected ones>) ride separate branches the host
  update didn't touch. Continue into `/update-skills` to bring them up to date?"
- Option 1 (Recommended): "Continue into skill updates" — description: "Runs
  `/update-skills`, which re-applies your installed channels/providers to pull
  their latest upstream code. You pick which ones there."
- Option 2: "Skip — I'll run `/update-skills` myself later" — description: "Your
  installed skill code stays as-is and may be behind upstream."

Keep it to these two options — the per-skill selection lives inside
`/update-skills`, not here.

- On "Continue": invoke `/update-skills` using the Skill tool. (If the re-apply
  touches container code, `/update-skills` rebuilds the agent image itself — see
  its Step 4 — so nothing container-related is owed back here.)
- On "Skip": note that `/update-skills` can be run anytime, then proceed.

## Known behavior changes when channel adapters update

Channel adapters now declare per-channel wiring defaults (engage mode, threading,
sender policy). Updating trunk alone changes nothing for existing rows, but once
`/update-skills` pulls current adapter copies, two deliberate behavior changes
land. If the user's install has Slack, Discord, or WhatsApp, tell them:

1. **Slack/Discord DM replies move top-level.** Both adapters now declare
   `threads: false` for DMs, so DM replies stop chasing per-message sub-threads
   and land in the main DM view, matching the DM session (which was already
   flat). Group/channel threading is unchanged. To keep the old in-thread DM
   behavior for a specific wiring, override it per wiring:
   `ncl wirings update <wiring-id> --threads true`.
2. **Shared-identity channels stop raising stranger approval cards.** On
   channels where the linked account is the operator's personal identity, the
   mechanics differ by channel: WhatsApp personal-number mode suppresses the
   mention signal entirely (no auto-created messaging groups, no cards);
   iMessage and WeChat still emit DM mention signals — stranger DMs still
   auto-create `messaging_groups` rows — but their declared `strict` policy
   makes those rows drop unknown senders silently instead of raising
   channel-registration cards to the admin.

**WhatsApp installs on a shared/personal number should re-run `/add-whatsapp`**
after the skill update: it now asks the dedicated-vs-personal question
explicitly (writing `ASSISTANT_HAS_OWN_NUMBER` to `.env`), audits for legacy
mis-wired group rows from spam-era approval cards, and shows how to clear
stale pending approvals.

Proceed to Step 7.9.

# Step 7.9: Stamp the upgrade marker (required)
After validation has **succeeded**, record that this install reached the new version through the supported path. Without this, the startup tripwire stops the host on its next start.

- `pnpm exec tsx scripts/upgrade-state.ts set "" update-nanoclaw`
  - The empty version argument stamps the current `package.json` version.

If validation did NOT succeed, do not stamp — leave the tripwire to catch the broken state.

Proceed to Step 8.

# Step 8: Summary + rollback instructions
Show:
- Backup tag: the tag name created in Step 1
- New HEAD: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
- Upstream HEAD: `git rev-parse --short upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH`
- Conflicts resolved (list files, if any)
- Breaking changes applied (list migrations completed, if any)
- Unresolved breaking migrations (list skipped, failed, or incomplete migrations)
- Remaining local diff vs upstream: `git diff --name-only upstream/$UPSTREAM_BRANCH..HEAD`

If unresolved migrations remain, explain plainly that the code update succeeded
but affected features may ignore old state until those migrations run. Use
AskUserQuestion before showing restart commands:

- **Run unresolved migrations (Recommended):** invoke each unresolved skill or
  follow each unresolved guide, removing it from the list only after successful
  completion and verification.
- **Restart anyway:** continue only with explicit confirmation and repeat the
  unresolved migration names in the final warning.

If a retried migration remains unresolved, ask again. Do not show restart
commands until the unresolved list is empty or the user explicitly chooses
Restart anyway.

Tell the user:
- To rollback: `git reset --hard <backup-tag-from-step-1>`
- Backup branch also exists: `backup/pre-update-<HASH>-<TIMESTAMP>`
- Restart the service to apply changes. The unit/label names are per-install — derive them with `setup/lib/install-slug.sh`. Run from your NanoClaw project root:
  - **macOS (Darwin)**: `source setup/lib/install-slug.sh && launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/$(launchd_label)`
  - **Linux**: `source setup/lib/install-slug.sh && systemctl --user restart $(systemd_unit)` (or, if you want to confirm the unit name first: `systemctl --user list-units --type=service | grep "$(. setup/lib/install-slug.sh && systemd_unit)"`)
  - **Manual** (no service found): restart `pnpm run dev`
