/**
 * Per-channel wizard extension registries — the trunk seams that keep
 * setup/auto.ts and run-channel-skill.ts free of channel-specific imports
 * and conditionals.
 *
 * Two registrations, both consulted generically by the channel flow:
 *
 *  - Auto-provision pre-step: runs BEFORE the channel's install skill
 *    and may return pre-bound skill `inputs` (e.g. when the channel's app /
 *    credentials can be obtained programmatically). The resolved agent name
 *    is passed in — for platforms where it doubles as the provisioned app's
 *    name. Returning undefined means "walk the manual path"; the skill flow
 *    then prompts as usual. Pre-steps own their prompts and must never throw
 *    for expected declines.
 *
 *  - Companion skills: additional skills applied right after the
 *    channel's main install skill, each with per-skill restarts skipped and
 *    ONE deferred service restart after all of them (see
 *    run-channel-skill.ts). For channels whose full payload is bigger than
 *    the adapter install itself.
 *
 * Registration import point: a channel feature payload appends its
 * self-registration import below (same discipline as the src/channels/index.ts
 * adapter barrel) — trunk ships none.
