/**
 * "Reject with reason…" capture flow.
 *
 * When an admin clicks the third approval button, the reject is held instead of
 * finalized: the row is parked at status='awaiting_reason' and the admin is
 * prompted in their DM for a one-line reason. Their next DM (≤ 280 chars) is
 * captured by a router message-interceptor and relayed to the requesting agent
 * as one combined message — `Your <action> request was rejected by admin:
 * "<reason>"`. A plain Reject never arms this, so an unrelated DM is never
 * swallowed.
 *
 * Restart-safety: arming lives in an in-memory map (lost on restart, like the
 * agent-naming capture it mirrors), but the hold is a durable DB row. If the
 * admin never replies — or the host restarts mid-capture — the host sweep
 * (sweepAwaitingReasonRejects, run each tick) finalizes a plain reject once the
 * row's window elapses, so the requesting agent is never stranded.
 *
 * Reuses, not reinvents: the agent-naming prompt-then-capture pattern
 * (in-memory map + next-DM interceptor) and the shared finalizeReject path.
