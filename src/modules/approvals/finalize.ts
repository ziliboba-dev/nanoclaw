/**
 * Shared "finalize a rejected approval" path.

 *   1. The instant Reject button            (response-handler.ts)
 *   2. A captured Reject-with-reason reply   (reason-capture.ts)
 *   3. The host-sweep ghost finalizer        (reason-capture.ts, via host-sweep)
 *
 * Kept in its own leaf file so both response-handler.ts and reason-capture.ts
 * can import it without an import cycle (finalize → primitive only).
