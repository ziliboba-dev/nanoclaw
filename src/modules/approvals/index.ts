/**
 * Approvals module — admin approval primitive + response plumbing.
 *
 * Default-tier module. Ships with main. Other modules depend on it by
 * importing `requestApproval` / `registerApprovalHandler` from this module.
 *
 * Registers:
 *   - A response handler that claims pending_approvals rows and dispatches
 *     to whatever module registered for the row's `action` string. Also
 *     resolves in-memory OneCLI credential approvals.
 *   - A message-interceptor (via ./reason-capture.js) that captures an admin's
 *     one-line reply after they click "Reject with reason…".
 *   - An adapter-ready callback that starts the OneCLI manual-approval handler
 *     once the delivery adapter is set.
 *   - A shutdown callback that stops the OneCLI handler cleanly.
 *
 * Exposes `sweepAwaitingReasonRejects` for the host sweep to finalize ghosted
 * reject-with-reason holds (re-exported here, which also loads reason-capture
 * so its interceptor registers).
 *
 * Self-mod flows (install_packages, add_mcp_server) moved out to
 * `src/modules/self-mod/` in PR #7 — they now register delivery actions
 * + approval handlers via this module's public API.
